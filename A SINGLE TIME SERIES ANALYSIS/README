The aim of the analysis is to examine the seasonality and trend among people visiting Australia in the period from 1985 to 2005 based on monthly data.
The analysis aims to identify patterns and changes in the number of short-term overseas visitors to Australia over these 21 years.

In particular, the aim is to determine whether there is seasonality in the number of visitors, that is, whether there are regular patterns of change depending on the seasons.
In addition, we aim to identify a trend, i.e. whether the number of visitors tends to increase, decrease or remains stable over a longer period of time.

By analyzing monthly data and using appropriate statistical methods, seasonality and trends in the number of visitors to Australia are examined.
The analysis also allows predictions of future values, which can be valuable for management and planning decisions related to tourism in Australia.
